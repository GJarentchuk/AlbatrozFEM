# AlbatrozFEM

Albatroz FEM is a Finite Element Method (FEM) software developed for simplified structural analysis, mostly developed in Lua. It uses unidimensional (1D) modified Euler beam elements, with corrections that attempts to better represent shear stresses for shorter beams.

Most of the program was developed back in 2012 to assist [Albatroz Team](https://equipealbatroz.com.br/) from Santa Catarina State University (UDESC - Joinville, Brazil) aircraft design for the national SAE Aerodesign competition. This version is a patch of the original code to provide minor bug fixes and to run the program without having to install many additional dependencies.

The goal was to provide a structural analysis tool with a mathematical model that could be learned relatively quickly by a novice engineering student, but robust enough to be used as reliable design tool for a large array of potential structural configurations the aircraft could have. In fact, the team had a design philosophy of always to conceive a strutural design that could be evaluated by a combination of numerical models + empirical tests and corrections.

Internally among Albatroz members, this program is known as Albatroz Parametric, as it was intended later on adding structural optimization tools.

AlbatrozFEM is written in Lua and was only tested for Windows. It uses the following third party tools:
  * A simple linear system solver written in C, by Guilherme Espíndola;
  * treeview.lua is part of nadzoru, by Yuri Kaszubowski Lopes;
  * [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) as 3D mesh and result visualisation tool, by Christophe Geuzaine and Jean-François Remacle.


## Instalation

It's a portable program, just download all the contents to a local folder. After that, open "Config.lua" and change the file path of "working_directory" and "default_project". Beware that double backslahses are needed.

If running the program manually from CMD (useful for seeing terminal error messages), run as the following:

    SET PATH=%CD%\GTK2;%PATH% & lua AlbatrozFEM.lua

## Known Issues

* There are two disabled buttons regarding "scenarios". It was a planned feature that would allow to have variations of loads, constraints and element material types within the same project. Due time constrains it was never finished.
* "Save as" button: user MUST manually write ".pro" extension on file name.
* "View results" window:
  * If asked to plot results before any simulation had already run (like upon opening the application), it'll crash the program.
  * "Deformed mesh" doesn't work for stress plotting. It'll always plot undeformed.
* Anytime a file chooser dialog is brought up, there will be a message on the terminal complaining about a "gtk-file" icon missing.
* "Export mesh to STEP" file works, but the resulting .stp file may not be opened properly by some tools.
* Sometimes, nodes and elements generated by interpolation crashes the solver.
* Manual adding of new materials is still needed if .mat files are just copied into materials folder.
* No alphabetical sorting of materials.
